# This project intentionally uses development dependencies for the project dependencies.

# The aim of this project is to provide a common denominator for python development dependencies
# in one package that can be added as a development dependency to other projects.  By using
# poetry to resolve and maintain a common set of compatible development dependencies, it may
# help to reduce the burdens of package installations for projects using this project as a
# development dependency.
